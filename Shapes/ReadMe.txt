This example shows inheritence without polymorhism.
The mechanics of inheritence are shown.  The need for polymophism is shown by 
the incorrect behavior of the 'Drawing'.   
Inheritance in programming requires polymorphism to behave as you would expect.

This example is good for the first steps in learning inheritence, but does not illustrate polymorhism, 
an interconnected concept we will learn later.
